# Activitus Bar

One of my work colleagues was complaining about the activity bar wasting too much space, so this simply puts icons on the status bar that open the views of the activity bar. You can then hide the activity bar from the View menu...

## Configuration

The buttons are configurable, using `activitusbar.views`. This is a array containing objects with names, their associated icons and optional tooltips or labels. By default, all standard views are enabled, i.e. Explorer, Search, SCM, Debug and Extensions. (*See Default Configuration below*). When overriding the default settings, default icons will be used if not specified.

This extension also rebinds the main view selection keys. If you have modified the default key bindings, this may be an issue.

The panel views Terminal, Problems, Output and Debug Console can now also be moved to the activity bar. The extension supports these using the names "terminal", "problems", "output" and "debugConsole", again with default icons. These buttons will still work if the panel views are kept in the default location, but the views will not hide again if `activitusbar.toggleSidebar` is enabled.

The colour of the active and inactive buttons can also be specified using `activitusbar.activeColour` and `activitusbar.inactiveColour`. The configuration accepts either theme colour names (e.g. `editor.foreground`, see <https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color> for the full list), standard HTML/CSS colour names or hex colour codes (e.g. `#ff0000`). If the colours are not specified in the configuration, the current status bar foreground (`statusBar.foreground`) and the inactive activity bar icon (`activityBar.inactiveForeground`) are used.

If required, the position of the icons can be adjusted by changing the value of `activitusbar.priority` and `activitusbar.alignment`. The defaults are `99999` and `Left` which should place them at the far left or the status bar. Depending on what other extensions are installed, you may need to experiment to find a value which suits. For example, to move everything to the far right, try `Right` and `-99999`.

Now that custom view containers are available, the configuration has been extended to support this. To add a button for a custom view, you'll need to find the name of the view's container. One way to find it is to inspect the package.json file of the extension that provides the view (the keys under `contributes.views`). Alternatively, go to *Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts*, then click the **keybindings.json** link near the top. If you then scroll to the bottom of the opened file, you should find commands for opening views, e.g. `workbench.view.extension.test`. The portion after the last dot is the name of the view. Note: If the command is not shown, it may already be assigned to a key definition, in which case search the file for `workbench.view.extension` to try to locate it.

Once you have the name of the view, choose an icon (see known issues below) from the list of [codicons](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) and add an entry to `activitusbar.views` with the format **"{ "name": "extension.*&lt;view name&gt;*", "codicon": "*&lt;icon-name&gt;*"}**, e.g.

```json
{
    "name": "extension.test",
    "codicon": "beaker",
}
```

By default, clicking a button again will toggle the sidebar so that it is not visible. If you want to disable this behaviour, set `activitusbar.toggleSidebar` to false.

Normally configuration in your workspace settings overwrites your user settings. If you want to have a base set of buttons in your user settings and then have additional buttons on a per workspace basis, set `activitusbar.combineWorkspaceSettings` to `true`. This will then combine the settings together for each vscode window.

One last option is `activitusbar.searchViewInPanel`. If you move the search view to the panel (using the context menu) then set this to true to allow the panel to be toggled instead of the sidebar. *Note: Don't set this to true with the search view in the normal position!*

### Separators

You can add spaces between buttons by including an empty object (`{}`) in the view list. If you want a spacer with an icon, just include an icon without a view name, e.g.

```json
{
    "codicon": "kebab-vertical"
}
```

### Task Buttons

Buttons can also be configured to start tasks. Just use "task.*task-label*". For example, this:

```json
{
    "name": "task.build",
    "codicon": "tools",
    "tooltip": "Build project"
}
```

will create a button with the tools icons which starts the "build" task when the button is clicked.

### Command Buttons

Buttons can also be configured to run arbitrary commands. Use "command.*command-name*". For example,

```json
{
    "name": "command.workbench.action.reloadWindow",
    "codicon": "refresh"
}
```

will create a button which reloads the window.

### Settings Button

You can also add a button which opens the settings GUI using

```json
{
    "name": "settings",
    "codicon": "gear"
}
```

*Note: Buttons can all have optional tooltips and labels specified. Labels are added to the right of the icon.*

### Default Configuration

```json
"activitusbar.views": [
    {
      "name": "explorer",
      "codicon": "files"
    },
    {
      "name": "search",
      "codicon": "search"
    },
    {
      "name": "scm",
      "codicon": "source-control"
    },
    {
      "name": "debug",
      "codicon": "debug"
    },
    {
      "name": "extensions",
      "codicon": "extensions"
    }
  ]
```

## Known Issues

Because there is no way to know when a view has been selected, the currently active view will not stay in sync if the normal activity bar is used.

If **Find in Files** is selected from the Edit Menu, again, the currently active view will become out of sync.

## Installing

You can install the latest version of the extension via the Visual Studio Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.activitusbar).

Alternatively, open Visual Studio code, press `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P` and type:

```sh
> ext install activitusbar
```
